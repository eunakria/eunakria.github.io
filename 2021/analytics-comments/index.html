You've read the title; you know what this is about. Starting today, I'm using <a href=https://www.goatcounter.com/ >GoatCounter</a> for analytics, and <a href=https://utteranc.es/ >utterances</a> for comments.</p><p>The addition of analytics will likely displease some of the more privacy-minded of you, so this is in equal parts a warning. You may want to install an ad blocker if you don't like analytics services. In addition, rest assured that GoatCounter is acutely privacy-minded and open-source for any audits you may wish to perform.</p><p><em>So, why?</em></p><p class=indent>So far, many friends have visited my website, and I'm thankful for all their support. Probably, you, reading this right now, are one of my friends! And, in that case, hello! Thanks a lot for sticking with me and being a great person. I'm truly thankful to have you in my life. But, I digress – it'd be a little strange to compose an open letter about how grateful I am for my friendships.</p><p class=indent>But, I want to have a greater understanding of the scope of my site. I want to know how much traffic my site actually does get, who is visiting it, and how you guys feel about it. That's why I want to add comments and analytics. I feel like having this information at hand will give me a better idea what to focus on, what to improve, and a sense of perspective about my writing, as well – I want to know what I got right and, more importantly, wrong, and I'm hoping that exposing an interface to y'all to call me out will foster some productive discussions.</p><p>If you read the title of this article, you may have also noticed that I said something about the "path forwards". It may not have been clear what I meant by this. I want my personal site to be a place where I discuss serious matters in long form. Until now, I've dropped the occasional detailed thread on Twitter, but generally refrained from talking about serious things, including perspectives like <a href=/2021/the-inaccessible-terminal/ >my last article</a>, and especially my political stances.</p><p>I want to start using this site to talk about serious things in detail, painting vivid perspectives that I hold on the world, and opening them to challenge. That's why I'm making these changes. I want to derive the same perspective from this site as I can from making a tweet, while not inundating my actual Twitter account with stuff most of you won't care about. Microblogging should be, well, micro, and this site shall be for the macro stuff.</p><p>That's all for now. Thanks for sticking with me; until next!</p><style>.indent {
