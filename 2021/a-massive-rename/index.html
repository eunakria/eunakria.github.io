I go by whatever name I come up with at a moment's notice, and come up with a new one in the event of a collision. However, this practice is clearly confusing to people who meet me, and it's starting to tire me, quite frankly. Clearly, change is necessary.</p><p>So, say hello to Eunakria! It's the same me you know and love<sup><a href=#fn-1>1</a></sup>, but with a brand-new name and face! I'm not kidding about the "face" bit either – I've drawn a character specifically for the occasion. From now on, this shall be my profile picture on social media:</p><img src=/res/2021-04-05-new-art.jpg alt="My new face!" class=body-img><p><em>"Well, why 'Eunakria'?"</em></p><p class=indent>Eunakria is the word for 'fox' in one of my conlangs, or constructed languages, named Mitra. It's a nice word; it sounds euphonous, and it has a nice meaning. I want to come off as a pleasant, well-natured person, so I chose the word Eunakria to symbolize that. As an added bonus, it's almost perfectly unique; as far as I know, the word exists in no major language and the username <code>eunakria</code> is exceedingly rare.</p><p><em>"How do you pronounce it?"</em></p><p class=indent>In the IPA pronunciation notation, <b>/əʷ.na.kɾja/.</b> Obviously, most of those phonemes don't exist in English, so you may instead want to pronounce it <b>/juˈnɑ.kri.ɑ/.</b></p><p><em>"Who's that in the drawing?"</em></p><p class=indent>It's me! Well, sort of. Initially, it was supposed to symbolize me one-to-one, but admittedly, I got a little creative. In real life, I have a far more masculine appearance, and obviously don't have elf ears. Truthfully, I wouldn't mind if I <em>did</em> have elf ears...</p><p>Anyway, that's all. You previously knew me by some arbitrary coinage; now I'm Eunakria. Until next!</p><hr class=short><p><sup id=fn-1>1</sup> You probably don't love me. I hope you don't.</p><style>.two-cols {
