You may want to install an ad blocker if you don't like analytics services.

It's a well-known fact at this point that the traditional UNIX-like terminal model (hereafter the shell) is notorious for committing a lot of sins on this aspect, and modern UI/UX designers generally see the shell as a keen example of what <em>not</em> to do. To quote <em>The Unix Hater's Handbook,</em> a humorous take on the bad design of UNIX from the early Macintosh era:]]></summary>
