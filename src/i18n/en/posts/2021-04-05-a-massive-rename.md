Hey there! My name is Eunakria, but you probably don't know me by that name. That's because over the past few years, I've accumulated a lot of nicknames in various different circles, none of which unique and many of which niche.

	</div>
</ul>

You've probably seen me use a couple different profile pictures, too; most especially, either of these:

<div class="two-cols pfp-cont">
	<img class="pfp" src="/res/2021-04-05-pfp-1.png" alt="One of my old profile pictures.">
	<img class="pfp" src="/res/2021-04-05-pfp-2.png" alt="Another of my old profile pictures.">
</div>

For a long while, this has done just fine. I go by whatever name I come up with at a moment's notice, and come up with a new one in the event of a collision. However, this practice is clearly confusing to people who meet me, and it's starting to tire me, quite frankly. Clearly, change is necessary.

So, say hello to Eunakria! It's the same me you know and love<sup><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but with a brand-new name and face! I'm not kidding about the "face" bit either &ndash; I've drawn a character specifically for the occasion. From now on, this shall be my profile picture on social media:

<img src="/res/2021-04-05-new-art.jpg" alt="My new face!">

*"Well, why 'Eunakria'?"*

<p class="indent">Eunakria is the word for 'fox' in one of my conlangs, or constructed languages, named Oksit. It's a nice word; it sounds euphonous, and it has a nice meaning. I want to come off as a pleasant, well-natured person, so I chose the word Eunakria to symbolize that. As an added bonus, it's almost perfectly unique; as far as I know, the word exists in no major language and the usernames <code>Eunakria</code> and <code>eunakria</code> are exceedingly rare.</p>

*"How do you pronounce it?"*

<p class="indent">In the IPA pronunciation notation, <b>/əʷ.na.kɾja/.</b> Obviously, most of those phonemes don't exist in English, so you may instead want to pronounce it <b>/juˈnɑ.kri.ɑ/.</b></p>

<!--<p class="indent">If you can listen to audio, here's a sample for you:</p>

[TBD]-->

*"Who's that in the drawing?"*

<p class="indent">It's me! Well, sort of. Initially, it was supposed to symbolize me one-to-one, but admittedly, I got a little creative. In real life, I have a far more masculine appearance, and obviously don't have elf ears. Truthfully, I wouldn't mind if I <em>did</em> have elf ears...</p>

Anyway, that's all. You previously knew me by some arbitrary coinage; now I'm Eunakria. Until next!
